# Introduction
## This project is in development process

This project explores the application of artificial intelligence in cryptocurrency trading and is intended solely for research and educational purposes.

Bitbot is an AI trading bot engineered to analyze and operate on major cryptocurrency tickers, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA). The system leverages a suite of technical indicators to generate insights, which then feed into a sophisticated AI algorithm. This algorithm is designed to intelligently determine entry and exit points for market operations, optimizing for buy or sell decisions.

The core predictive engine of Bitbot is powered by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model, implemented using TensorFlow. This model is trained on historical price data for the selected cryptocurrencies and timeframes to forecast future price movements.
